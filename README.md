This repo keeps a list of cornerstone articles that every developer will read sooner or later in his career.

If you want to share a link to a cornerstone article, create an issue for it. Cool? 

Here are some arbitrary criteria for cornerstone articles.
- The article describes not a product (like Angular) but rather a [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm)
- The article describes something that has become consensus amongst developers.
- You've probably seen the article being linked in your career a few times before.
- The article is written a few years ago. Some more than 10 years ago.
